For the last two years I used mainly Mac OS X. Before that I was a Linux user
for quite a long time.

Recently I've got tired of Mac a bit and decide to take a look at modern state
of Linux. In this series of posts I will try to describe my adventures in a
Linux-land starting from installation and to some notes about every-day usage.

First of all I installed latest **Ubuntu** - but was gravely disappointed by
it. Long in short, it's trying to be a Mac-like, but forgetting about its
*roots*. Maybe it's just me, but I wanted a more flexible and configurable
system right out the box, and Ubuntu failed at providing this. At the same
time the visual part of Ubuntu is, in my opinion, still far behind the Mac,
although I can't say it's ugly). As to the usability of Unity, I can't say
anything, because I used it for maybe 1 or 2 hours and quickly understood that
I'm looking for something else.

So I decided to install **Arch Linux**...
